                <img src="assets/images/homePage/heroHomePage.jpg" alt="Great Pyramids of Giza">
                <p>There are 3 pyramids (one not pictured to do physical distance from the others). 
                  Each was built for Pharaohs: Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. Khufu's pyramid, The Great Pyramid, is the northernmost pyramid (pictured right). 
                  It is the biggest and oldest. It originally stood at 481.4 feet.
                   Khafre's pyramid is located in the middle and once stood at 471 feet (pictured left). Menkaure's pyramid is the southernmost
                  pyramid and stood at 218 feet when it was built. Tourists are allowed to go into The Great Pyramid through narrow tunnels
                and see the Pharaoh's chamber. </p>

                <h4>Great Sphinx of Giza</h4>
                <img src="assets/images/landmarks/sphinx.jpg" alt="Great Sphinx of Giza">
                <p>The Great Sphinx is made from limestone like the pyramids. Historians believe that it was built during the
                  time of Pharaoh Khafre because it resembles his face. A sphinx is a human head with a royal headdress and a lion's body
                   This is the world's biggest sculpture spanning 240 feet long and 66 feet tall.

                <p>This was the home of Pharaoh Khafre. It was burried by sand and later discovered by egyptologist Auguste Mariette in 1852.
                  Because of its late discovery, it is the best preserved structure from the Fourth Dynasty.

                <img src="assets/images/landmarks/stepPyramid.jpg" alt="Step Pyramid of Pharaoh Zoser">
                <p>This pyramid was designed to be a tomb for Pharaoh Djoser during the Third Dynasty.
                   It stands at 204 feet and has 6 layers of steps. The vizer of Djoser, Imhotep, wanted his pharoah to have
                  a tomb that stood out so he thought of making the pyramid look like steps. </p>

              <p>This pyramid was built during the time of Pharaoh Sneferu. It is bent because was an attempt at building a true pyramid. 
                The bottom half has an angle of 52ยบ and was found to be too steep so the upper half was built at a 43.5ยบ angle.
