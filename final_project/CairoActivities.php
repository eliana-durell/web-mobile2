      <p>Camels can stand at 5.9 to 6.6 feet tall, but this is measured just at the shoulder height!
         Camels can carry up to 200 pounds and are used to help humans travel through the desert whether that 
         be carrying items or carrying the person. Theyâ€™ve been domesticated for more than 3,000 years. 
         In Egypt, tourists can ride on a camel. </p>

      <p>Seeing the Pyramids during the day is jaw-dropping, but have you seen them at night?
